# Session 2: Starting a new Theme

We will work to create a custom theme for the rest of next part of this training. Our custom theme will be called "bear_skin". 

A designer has completed a mockup showing a representative page display with this theme. Notice the elements it has and their placement. Does it have a max-width? Does it have a header, footer, logo, site name, sidebars, primary links menu, and secondary links menu? Where will it require background images? Which HTML elements (h1, h2, h3, p, a, li) does it represent? Do you see any common Drupal elements that the design does not represent which you would have to infer from the general design or ask the designer to address?
