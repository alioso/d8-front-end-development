# Session 2: Starting a new theme

We will work to create a custom theme for the next part of this training. Our custom theme will be called "bear_skin". The name comes from an existing D8 theme on drupal.org. https://www.drupal.org/project/bear_skin that you can download to see a final version of what we'll be covering in this guide.

In our scenario, a designer has completed mockups showing a home page and interior page. First step is to identify the various regions and elements the layout asks for. Does it have a max-width? Does it have a banner, header, footer, logo, site name, sidebars, primary links menu, or secondary links menu?

Do you see any common Drupal elements that the design does not represent which you would have to infer from the general design or ask the designer to address?

These first steps are crucial to save development time in the future. A good assessment of the site's assets guaranties a  solid base for development and collaborative work. Think of it as a cooking recipe. You first need to have all the ingredients, but the recipe won't tell you everything, you'll need to also evaluate what you don't see yet and try to plan ahead of time to ensure scalability.
