# Drupal Behaviors

Drupal uses the concept of jQuery behaviors. When a page loads, all the behaviors are run. Behaviors can be asked to load again after the initial page load, for example after an AJAX call adds additional elements to the page. 



More information about behaviors and debugging jQuery in Drupal is available in this [excellent article](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/understanding-javascript-behaviors-in-drupal).
