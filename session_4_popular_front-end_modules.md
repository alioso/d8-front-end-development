Drupal is well known for its wide and very active community, providing hundreds of contributed modules to help you achieve your goals. Before reinventing the wheel or spend many hours writing custom code for a specific purpose, check the [repository of contributed modules](https://www.drupal.org/search/site/?f%5B0%5D=&f%5B1%5D=&f%5B2%5D=&f%5B3%5D=drupal_core%3A7234&f%5B4%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull&f%5B5%5D=ss_meta_type%3Amodule&solrsort=iss_project_release_usage+desc) on drupal.org to see if anyone has come up with a solution that suits your needs. Chances are that what you need to also needed by many other people who already contributed their time to create a solution.
