# Introduction to Drupal Theming

A lot of changes have been introduced between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8. The more important one  being the switch from PHPTemplate to Twig. This training documentation contains information and tutorials that will explain and illustrate the  new processes to build a Drupal 8 theme the right way. 

Note: In addition to this guide we will also make extensive use of the excellent Drupal.org Theme Handbook as a reference: https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8
