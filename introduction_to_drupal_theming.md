# Introduction to Drupal Theming

A lot of changes have been introduced between Drupal 7 and Drupal 8. The more important one  being the switch from PHPTemplate to Twig. This training documentation contains information and tutorials that will explain and illustrate the  new processes to build a Drupal 8 theme the right way. 

Note: In addition to this guide we will also make extensive use of the excellent Drupal.org Theme Handbook as a reference: https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8

Everyone wants to hire the perfect Drupal developer - but you need a way to identify future potential Drupal front-end developers.

* What previous experiences and transferable skills are going to help someone make the switch to Drupal and excel on a busy team for a typical Drupal site owner?
* What are the transferable skills and characteristics someone could look for in a potential Drupal developer? 

There are many roles recognized in the Drupal community, they are often grouped them into three roles: Back-end developer, and Front-end developer and Site Builder.

* Change layouts, regions, images and fonts.
* Hide or display fields dependent on user role.
* Dynamically respond to changes in the content, or to user input.
* Modify or replace text (e.g. labels or attributes) and variables generated by modules.
* It's also possible to port open source designs between other systems (Joomla! templates, WordPress themes, etc.) and Drupal, or convert any website layout or template into a Drupal theme.
* Create a sub-theme. Your own version of a theme (existing or one that you create) that you can modify, while protecting the functionality of the original (base-theme) for update purposes creating a sub-theme.
