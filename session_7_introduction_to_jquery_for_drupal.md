# Session 7: Introduction to jQuery for Drupal


### What is jQuery?

"jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers."

From [Working with JavaScript and jQuery](https://www.drupal.org/node/171213).

"Using JavaScript adds dynamic presentation effects to a theme. In addition to custom JavaScript files many Drupal developers find jQuery useful. jQuery is a lightweight JavaScript library which is built into Drupal. jQuery contains all the common DOM, event, effects, and Ajax functions.

More comprehensive information on the JavaScript APIs and the use of JavaScript in Drupal can be found in the Developer Guide.

For more information about jQuery visit the jQuery API and Documentation site."
