# What is the theme layer?

The theme layer in Drupal is a system that allows you to override HTML and CSS created by Drupal core and contributed modules.

The theme system doesn't produce content or perform business operations. HTML and CSS is output by Drupal core and contributed modules and fed through the theme system which allows the changing of HTML and CSS output without changing the functions that produce that content.
