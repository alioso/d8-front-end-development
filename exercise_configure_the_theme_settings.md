# Exercise: Configure the theme settings

Drupal comes with some theme settings that can be configured in the administrative UI. This is where some of the site identity assets are defined, as well as a couple of other miscellaneous settings. A Global Settings page located at admin/appearance/settings will define your defaults. but each enabled theme can override these and have its own custom settings.
