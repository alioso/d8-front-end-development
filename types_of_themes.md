# Types of themes

**Core Themes**: Drupal core comes with a few themes. These are suitable for very basic sites. They should not be changed (hacked) nor used as a base for a custom theme.

**Contributed Themes**: http://drupal.org/project/themes These are free themes that have been contributed to the Drupal Community.  They are not part of any official release and may not have optimized functionality for your purposes.

**Custom Themes**: Most larger sites require a custom look and feel. These are often created as sub-themes of a starter theme.

**Premium Themes**:  Pre-made themes available for purchase. (e.g., fusiondrupalthemes.com or rockettheme.com) These often have an interface for site-specific customizations and commercial support.

**Starter Themes**:  A base theme with a basic layout and little styling designed to be used as a starting point for a custom sub-theme. It is typically much easier to create a custom theme from a starter theme than from scratch.

**Sub Themes**:  Theme based on a starter theme (inherits styles and templates). Sub themes are aimed at adding specific styling/overrides while keeping the update process and resources available for the base theme.

**Administration Themes**: Themes that are displayed only in administration sections of a site. Some sites use a separate admin theme that is more optimized for administrative pages (e.g. has a wider width for showing big forms).
