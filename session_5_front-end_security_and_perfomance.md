# Session 5: Front-End Security and Perfomance

The new Twig syntax is concise, easy to learn, and easy to read. That is a great addition to Drupal. While Twig increases the security for the Drupal compared to the PHP engine *(Twig uses a domain-specific language, which will automatically generate escaped, secure and correct HTML5, rather than embedding insecure, handwritten PHP and HTML directly)*, there are still important security principles to observe. Additionally, Twig offers powerful sandboxing, which allows restricted execution of untrusted code for safe integration with 3rd party themes and components. - See more at: https://dev.acquia.com/blog/drupal-8-success-stories/real-world-drupal-8-for-frontend-developers/30/09/2015/6891#sthash.4DmL86uf.dpuf
