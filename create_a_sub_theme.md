# Create a sub theme

To create a custom theme, many Drupal developers use a contributed (or their own custom) starter theme and create their custom theme as a sub-theme of it (never altering the contributed starter theme). 

Popular Drupal starter themes include Zen, Fusion, Adaptive Theme, Omega and Tao. At the time of this documentation, may of them are still in development and not quite production ready or don't have a d8 version yet.
