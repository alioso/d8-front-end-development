# Exercise: Create a bear_skin Subtheme

Sub-themes are just like any other theme, with one difference: They inherit the parent theme's resources. There are no limits on the chaining capabilities connecting sub-themes to their parents. A sub-theme can be a child of another sub-theme, and it can be branched and organized however you see fit. This is what gives sub-themes great potential.

Since we have created our own **bear_skin** starter theme, we are going to use it as a base theme for our new **bear_coat** sub theme.

**Step 1**: Create a theme_coat folder and place it either: 

* within you starter theme 


mysite > core > themes > custom > bear_skin

* or on the same level at
 

mysite > core > themes > custom

In our case we will place it within our starter theme, as this facilitates our git workflow.
