# Exercise: Create a bear_skin Subtheme

Sub-themes are just like any other theme, with one difference: They inherit the parent theme's resources. There are no limits on the chaining capabilities connecting sub-themes to their parents. A sub-theme can be a child of another sub-theme, and it can be branched and organized however you see fit. This is what gives sub-themes great potential.

Since we have created our own bear_skin starter theme, we are going to use it as a base theme for our new bear_coat sub theme.
